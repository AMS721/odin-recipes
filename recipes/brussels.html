<h3>Description</h3>
An easy recipe for carmelized brussel sprouts finished with a dash of balsamic vinegar.
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <uo>
        <li>1 pint brussels sprouts (about a pound)</li>
        <li>4 to 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, to coat bottom of pan</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 400 degrees. Trim bottom of brussels sprouts, and slice each in half top to bottom. Heat oil in cast-iron pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers; put sprouts cut side down in one layer in pan. Put in garlic, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook, undisturbed, until sprouts begin to brown on bottom, and transfer to oven. Roast, shaking pan every 5 minutes, until sprouts are quite brown and tender, about 10 to 20 minutes.</li>
